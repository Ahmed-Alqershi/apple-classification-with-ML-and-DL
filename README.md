# Apple Image Classification

Welcome to the Apple Image Classification repository! Here, we explore the world of apple classification using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used for this project is sourced from [apple_dataset](https://github.com/rifatkurban/apple_dataset), consisting of 20 images for each of the 6 different types of apples.

&nbsp;
## Dataset Overview

- **Dataset Source:** [apple_dataset](https://github.com/rifatkurban/apple_dataset)
- **Apple Types:** 6 (Refer to the dataset for specific types)
- **Images per Type:** 20

&nbsp;
## Classification Approaches

1. **Deep Learning Architectures (Transfer Learning):**
   - Utilizing pre-trained models such as ResNet, AlexNet, ExtremeNet, VGG, etc., via transfer learning.
   - Models will be fine-tuned on the apple dataset for improved accuracy.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
   - SVM (Support Vector Machines)
   - NN (Neural Network)
   - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
   - DT (Decision Tree)
   - RF (Random Forest)

3. **Feature Extraction Algorithms:**
   - SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features)
   - ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF)

&nbsp;
## Data Split and Evaluation

- **Data Split:** 5-fold cross-validation
- **Training:** 80% of the dataset
- **Testing:** 20% of the dataset

&nbsp;
## Performance Metric

- **Metric:** Test data classification accuracy
